# SmartSafe
Smart home security group project created by small team of UBC students from the department of computer engineering.
This repository contains modules of the project where I was a key contributer.

# Operation
This home security suite works via android phones and the security devices (such as locks) communicating with the 
server to provide 2-way authentication and a means to control home security systems remotely.

# Additional Information
This project was a submission to a 2nd year project in the department of electrical and computer engineering at UBC.
The repository contains only the source code.
